We propose the Incomplete Multimodality-Diffused emotion recognition (IMDer) method that maps input random noise to the distribution space of missing modalities and recovers missing data in accordance with their original distributions.

## The Framework of IMDer

![framework](Framework.png)

(1) IMDer maps input random noise to the distribution space of missing modalities and recovers missing data in accordance with their original distributions.
(2) To minimize the semantic ambiguity between the missing and recovered modalities, IMDer utilize the available modalities as prior conditions to guide and refine the recovering process.
Please refer to our [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BuGFwUS9B3) for details.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- PyTorch 1.9.0
- CUDA 11.4

### Datasets

Data files can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BBadVSptOe4h8TWchkhWZRLJw8YG_aEi), and you only need to download the aligned data.
You can put the downloaded datasets into `dataset/` directory.

### Pretrained weights

Before running missing cases, you should [download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rYqT-lR-TF73pEkfT_csA-_YeHpEK84d?usp=drive_link) the weights pretrained by complete multimodal data (i.e., MR=0.0).
You can put the downloaded weights into `pt/` directory.

### Run the Codes

Running the following command:

```python
python train.py
```
